# UpFantasy (My personal project)

UpFantasy is my project whose code is public here on GitHub.
It is a plugin that is supposed to customize the server for its
own game type. The principle of the game is simple, at the beginning
you have to choose one of the four default characters. Each character
has their own abilities, their own story, their world and their skill-tree.
